"{\"engine\": \"text-davinci-003\", \"prompt\": \"Claim: snow makes people sick.\\n\\nAbstract: It would occupy a long time to give an account of the progress of cholera over different parts of the world, with the devastation it has caused in some places, whilst it has passed lightly over others, or left them untouched; and unless this account could be accompanied with a description of the physical condition of the places, and the habits of the people, which I am unable to give, it would be of little use. There are certain circumstances, however, connected with the progress of cholera, which may be stated in a general way. It travels along the great tracks of human intercourse, never going faster than people travel, and generally much more slowly. In extending to a fresh island or continent, it always appears first at a sea-port. It never attacks the crews of ships going from a country free from cholera to one where the disease is prevailing, till they have entered a port, or had intercourse with the shore. Its exact progress from town to town cannot always be traced; but it has never appeared except where there has been ample opportunity for it to be conveyed by human intercourse. There are also innumerable instances which prove the communication of cholera, by individual cases of the disease, in the most convincing manner. Instances such as the following seem free from every source of fallacy. I called lately to inquire respecting the death of Mrs. Gore, the wife of a labourer, from cholera, at New Leigham Road, Streatham. I found that a son of deceased had been living and working at Chelsea. He came home ill with a bowel complaint, of which he died in a day or two. His death took place on August 18th. His mother, who attended on him, was taken ill on the next day, and died the day following (August 20th). There were no other deaths from cholera registered in any of the metropolitan districts, down to the 26th August, within two or three miles of the above place; the nearest being.\\n\\nNow, answer these two questions:\\nQ1. Is the claim and abstract related or unrelated?\\nQ2. How can someone accurately extract the main point of the abstract in relation to the claim?(Only extract detail about the salient relation. Do NOT provide any stance about the claim. )\\n\\n\\n\", \"stop_token\": \"###\", \"temperature\": 0.0, \"max_tokens\": 500.0, \"first_response\": \"Q1. The claim and abstract are related.\\n\\nQ2. The abstract provides evidence that cholera is spread through human contact and travel, and that it can be spread by individual cases of the disease. It also provides an example of a family in which a son contracted a bowel complaint and died, and his mother, who had attended to him, was taken ill and died the day after. This example supports the claim that cholera can be spread through contact with an infected person.\"}"
